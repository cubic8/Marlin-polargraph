## Marlin 2.0

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Example Configurations

Before building Marlin you'll need to configure it for your specific hardware. Your vendor should have already provided source code with configurations for the installed firmware, but if you ever decide to upgrade you'll need updated configuration files. Marlin users have contributed dozens of tested example configurations to get you started. Visit the [MarlinFirmware/Configurations](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations) repository to find the right configuration for your hardware.

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). Detailed build and install instructions are posted at:

  - [Installing Marlin (Arduino)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html)
  - [Installing Marlin (VSCode)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html).

## Contributors

Marlin is constantly improving thanks to a huge number of contributors from all over the world bringing their specialties and talents. Huge thanks are due to [all the contributors](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/graphs/contributors) who regularly patch up bugs, help direct traffic, and basically keep Marlin from falling apart. Marlin's continued existence would not be possible without them.

## Administration

Regular users can open and close their own issues, but only the administrators can do project-related things like add labels, merge changes, set milestones, and kick trolls. The current Marlin admin team consists of:

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.

## Hardware

Use Makelangelo - uses GCODE (PolarGrapg uses custom)

We have:
  - Mega 2560
  - RAMPS 1.4
  - A4988 Drivers
  - LCD (+SD)

[for example](https://www.makerstore.com.au/product/elec-3d-ramps1-4-control-pack/)

Use [this diagram](https://www.reprap.org/mediawiki/images/0/06/RAMPS_dossier.pdf) to remove items we dont need
eg.
  - extruder
  - thermisters
  - heatbed
  - hotend

* [My fork of Marlin](https://github.com/cubic8/Marlin-polargraph)


Use:

  X - Stepper
  Y - Stepper
  Servo - Penup/down

Need end stops on X/Y belts, when full pulled in (gondola at lowest)
Place in motor mount when weight reaches top

## Other info

Use M280 to lift pen (generic servo command)

## To Compile

* Open VSCode
* Install Marlin extension (will add PIO IDE too - which incudes PIO core)
* Create workspace and include this folder
* Update Configuration.h as required
* Choose environment on bottom PIO toolbar: ie. env:mega2560
* Build: Click tick on PIO toolbar
* Ensure USB is conencted to hardware (Note I had instelled Arduino IDE previously so USB drivers were present - you may have to sort this out first)
* Upload: Click the 'Right Arrow' icon on the PIO toolbar
* Serial Port Monitor: Click on the plug icon on the PIO toolbar

# GCODE Helpers

## Debug helpers
* M114                - Show current positions
* M111 S255           -- Set max debug level (sends to term I believe)
* M43                 - Show pins/ports used
* M43 E1              - Watch Endstops - list changes as they occur
* M928 log.txt        - Log to file on SD card (se M29 to stop)
* M211                - Report/Enable software endstops (eg for Z ?)

## Typical file commands
* G28                 - Home all axis
* M300 P200           - Beep for 200ms
* G21                 - Use mm
* G90                 - Absolute positions
* G91                 - Relative positions
* G0 Xnnn Ynnn Fxxxx  - Non-draw move (fast)
* G1 Xnnn Ynnn Fxxxx  - Draw move (controlled)
* M280 P0             - Show servo 0 position
* M280 P0 S100        - Set servo 0 position
      Use pen retracted -> M280 P0 S20
         Use pen active -> M280 P0 S200
